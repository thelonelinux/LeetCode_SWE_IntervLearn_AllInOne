# GRAPH LEARNING
* Self Notes Added (AVOID NOTES - AS THEY ARE JUST IMPLEMENTATION - YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE CODE IN HERE)
    * 1. Graph self notes implement.pdf
        * Don't go deep in theory. Mostly do code implementation and problem solving based on graph.
        * This pdf you can see once. It's just normal theory of implementatoin.
        * Focuse mostly in coding on your own to implement graph and problem solving based on graph.


## A. GRAPH LEARNING PROCESS
### 1.  GRAPH IMPLEMENTATION AND BFS AND DFS IMPLEMENTATION IN JAVA 
* Implement Graph using Adjacency matrix and do bfs and dfs traversal in it.
* Implement Graph using Adjacency list and do bfs and dfs traversal in it
* Code added for both of them with better understanding. See the package Graph_code_Practise. done in java

### 2. PROBLEM SOLVING BASED ON GRAPH
* Solve problems like based on Dijkstras,
* Solve number of islands problem
* solve wormhole questions and other graph questions usually asked in Samsung coding test round.
* Rest I have added more resources below, check there and solve as many questions you can and understand.


## B. GRAPH IMPORTANT LEARNING LINKS 
* more important is you should be able to understand approach and then write code and explain

### 1. FROM STRIVER
* Strivers Complete DSA Learning with different pattern types and problem solved link
* https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/
* All videos problem link for each patter problem typs : 
* https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward/playlists
* Remember participating in contest in must to up skill your problem solving skills

### 2. OTHES
* https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph
* Following youtube videos by striver link below
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3_pLsDdeuU&list=PLgUwDviBIf0oE3gA41TKO2H5bHpPd7fzn&ab_channel=takeUforward
* https://takeuforward.org/graph/introduction-to-graph/
* for notes check above link
* Leetcode links for some graph problems and approach : 
* https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/655708/Graph-For-Beginners-Problems-or-Pattern-or-Sample-Solutions
* Don't make note of these things and no need to take printout
* just learn the approach, write the code as per your understanding and explaining way. first you can see in youtube, then write approach and then code thing
* In here only you can find link for exploring other DSA topics like linkedlist, tree etc.

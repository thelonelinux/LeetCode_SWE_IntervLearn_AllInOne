# FENWICK TREE (BINARY INDEXED TREE) AND SEGMENT TREE CONCEPT LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING
* Mostly used for range query sum problems.
* More details and related problems we will see below. 
* We will be adding the code and sample problem and learning below
* REM - FENWICK TREE WE DID FOR RANGE SUM
* REM - SEGMENT TREE WE DID FOR BOTH RANGE SUM AND MAX VALUE IN GIVEN RANGE.



## A. MY LEARNING (EXPLORING)
* 1. SELF MADE NOTES - Don't learn from notes, videos is fine and explains all. for notes just see for fenwick tree, 2's complement and fenwick tree how it looks.
* 2. YOUTUBE
* 3. LEETCODE FOR SAMPLE PROBLEMS



## B. FENWICK TREE LEARNING
### 1. NOTES ARE USELESS AS LONG AS I NOT MAKE A PROPER VIDEO TO EXPLAIN SO FIRST LEARN FROM YOUTUBE ONLY

### 2. YOUTUBE LEARNING 
* FOLLOWING PLAYLIST (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaXG62Y8Uw&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rf5CQf_HFt35_cF04d8dHN&index=1&ab_channel=takeUforward)
* Take you forward (Playlist by striver)
#### 1. YT FIRST VIDEO (FENWICK TREE AND UPDATE RANGE QUERY PROBLEM SOLVED)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaXG62Y8Uw&ab_channel=takeUforward
* This is done by striver only. so check it with use case example it has explained.
* It explains fenwick tree implementation and solve range update query problem within. 
* Code I have written in Code_Practise : Simple_FenwickTree.java (Check here)
* You need to understand how each index of fenwickTree array or BitArray (Binary Index Tree Array) shows a range.
* You can see this in youtube video only and  understand what exactly fenwickTree represent and how we are building it. 
* Once we have builded the tree how we can update if any new updates comes in. 
* You will understand only when you once make video by yourself with explanation in note code.
* THERE  are other continue videos in this playlist of striver for fenwick tree and also includes segment tree in same playlist


#### 2. YT SECOND VIDEO (SECOND PROBLEM WHICH CAN BE SOLVED USING FENWICK TREE)
* Skip for now as it contains another problem related to fenwick tree which can be solved by fenwick tree
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuUspQ7ORXE&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rf5CQf_HFt35_cF04d8dHN&index=2&ab_channel=takeUforward


#### 3. YT THIRD VIDEO (SEGMENT TREE UNDESTANDING AND IMPLEMENTATION)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dUiRtJ8ot0&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rf5CQf_HFt35_cF04d8dHN&index=3&ab_channel=takeUforward
* This video alone is enough to understand how to build segment tree, concept and internal logic.
* Problems like max value find in given range. 
* Problems like range sum (as we did in fenwick tree - just here instead of adding max we add sum from it's child node to root node.)
* How given n array we make segment tree of size 4*n is required.
* SO SEE THE VIDEO AND YOU WILL KNOW ENOUGH

#### 4. YT FOURTH VIDEO (LAZY PROPOGATION IN SEGMENT TREE)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwXVCELcrqU&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rf5CQf_HFt35_cF04d8dHN&index=4&ab_channel=takeUforward
* SKIPPED FOR NOW



#### 5. YT FIFTH VIDEO (SOME CODEFORCE PROBLEM INVOLVING BINARY SEARCH AND FENWICK TREE)

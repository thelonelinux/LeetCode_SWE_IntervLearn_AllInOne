# FENWICK TREE (BINARY INDEXED TREE) AND SEGMENT TREE CONCEPT LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING
* Mostly used for range query sum problems.
* More details and related problems we will see below. 
* We will be adding the code and sample problem and learning below



## A. MY LEARNING (EXPLORING)
* 1. SELF MADE NOTES
* 2. YOUTUBE
* 3. LEETCODE FOR SAMPLE PROBLEMS



## B. FENWICK TREE LEARNING
### 1. NOTES ARE USELESS AS LONG AS I NOT MAKE A PROPER VIDEO TO EXPLAIN SO FIRST LEARN FROM YOUTUBE ONLY

### 2. YOUTUBE LEARNING 
* FOLLOWING PLAYLIST (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaXG62Y8Uw&list=PLgUwDviBIf0rf5CQf_HFt35_cF04d8dHN&index=1&ab_channel=takeUforward)
#### 1. YT FIRST VIDEO (FENWICK TREE AND UPDATE RANGE QUERY PROBLEM SOLVED)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uaXG62Y8Uw&ab_channel=takeUforward
* This is done by striver only. so check it with use case example it has explained.
* It explains fenwick tree implementation and solve range update query problem within. 
* Code I have written in Code_Practise : Simple_FenwickTree.java (Check here)
* You need to understand how each index of fenwickTree array or BitArray (Binary Index Tree Array) shows a range.
* You can see this in youtube video only and  understand what exactly fenwickTree represent and how we are building it. 
* Once we have builded the tree how we can update if any new updates comes in. 
* You will understand only when you once make video by yourself with explanation in note code.
* THERE  are other continue videos in this playlist of striver for fenwick tree and also includes segment tree in same playlist


#### 2. YT SECOND VIDEO (SECOND PROBLEM WHICH CAN BE SOLVED USING FENWICK TREE)
* Skip for now as it contains another problem related to fenwick tree which can be solved by fenwick tree

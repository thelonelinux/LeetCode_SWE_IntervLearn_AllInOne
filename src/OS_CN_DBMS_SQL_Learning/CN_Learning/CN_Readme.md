# COMPUTER NETWORK LEARNING
* For solving numericals for gate related in computer network - follow the youtube playlist of computer network of GATE Walla - EE, EC, CS & IN

## LEARNING
* Interviewbit learning you can do in pdf added in here.
* Initial Notes added check that for OSI Model Basic Learning.

## GFG INDEX FOLLOW FOR LEARNING

## DIFFICULT TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND
### 1. ALL THOSE TOPICS IN SHUBHAM CLOUD AWS INCLUDED LEARN THOSE
### 2. SUBNETTING
### 3. ROUTERS VS OTHER NETWORK DEVICES, WHAT THEY MEAN HOW THEY WORK WITH PRACTICAL
### 4. IN DEPTH LEARNING OF ALL THE OSI MODEL LAYERS WITH THERE IN DEPTH PROTOCOLS.


## AVOID FOLLOWING YOUTUBE PLAYLIST FOR LEARNING
### 1. GATE SMASHERS - As they are only teaching by writing on blackboard. No Practical devices seen to understand in depth. As in interview we have to explain to interviewer with practical way.
### 2. KnowledgeGATE by Sanchit Sur - As in one video whole topic is there for 6 hours. Avoid it as we need processes learning with previous revision so.
### 3. MultiAtoms - It has same drawback as for 1 and 2 above.
### 4. Sudhakar Atchala - Same drawback as 1 above.
### 5. 5 Minutes Engineering - Same drawback as 1 above. (BUT THIS LOOKS GOOD)
### 6. GATE CSE LECTURES BY AMIT - Same drawback as 1 and 2 above
### 7. Perfect Computer Engineer - Same drawback as 1 above


## A. MY DEEP LEARNING VIA YOUTUBE (ENGINEERING FUNDA PLAYLIST - upto 20/136 videos are free. find other playlist or topicwise learn)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv_aTqoHCrM&list=PLgwJf8NK-2e6fvY8yegkzDBiK7ywj8ZhK&index=1&ab_channel=EngineeringFunda
* Best way to learn ====>>> JUST WATCH VIDEOS OF TOPICS WHICH YOU NEED TO LEARN AND DON'T UNDERSTAND FROM THIS PLAYLIST

### VIDEO 16/136: IP ADDRESS, MAC ADDRESS, PORT ADDRESS 
* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qmTsTcoCkY&list=PLgwJf8NK-2e6fvY8yegkzDBiK7ywj8ZhK&index=16&ab_channel=EngineeringFunda)
* Learn this in Youtube is enough

### VIDEO 20 ABOUT DATA LINK LAYERS LOOKS GOOD AS IT HAS GOOD CONTENT ABOUT HOW DATA LINK LAYER DOES FLOW AND ERROR CONTROL FOR FRAMES.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDb8pO2eDJ0&list=PLgwJf8NK-2e6fvY8yegkzDBiK7ywj8ZhK&index=17&ab_channel=EngineeringFunda
* Whereas in Transport layer, it did flow and error control for Packets.

### AFTER VIDEO 20/136, THE VIDEO IS NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR PAID MEMBERS. SO CHECK FOR NEW PLAYLIST


## B. MY DEEP LEARNING VIA YOUTUBE
* Find some good Computer Network Playlist or some topic wise learn
### 1. 5 Minutes Engineering - Same drawback as 1 above. (BUT THIS LOOKS GOOD)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V9mhVgVH3A&list=PLYwpaL_SFmcAXkWn2IR-l_WXOrr0n851a&ab_channel=5MinutesEngineering

# TASK TO DO WITH OS README ENHANCE
* Re-update the index.
* Some YT learn for basics of 05 (All in One put)
* Basics of 05 see GFG. Organize according to that.
* Now learn OS interviewbit once and get done with it.
* threads, types of 05, System calls, Kernels. Ceck in youtube and complete this as well.
* I checked the interviewbit questions - We are 90% good with 05 interview and topics added. But add above mentioned Basic OS topics with YT.
  Da us la complete the seed. But old above nentloned Basic Of topics with vT.
* Keep on revising whenever you can is most important.
* DBMS INDEX COPY AND PASTE FROM THAT GFG YOU KNOW. THAT LOOKS MORE SATISFYING. AND ALSO ATTACH LINK. BUT DON'T DO DEEP LEARNING FOR NOW.
* BETTER ASK FOR REFERAL AND DO LEETCODE AND LEARN JAVA CONCEPTS IN OFFICE FOR NOW.
* ALSO CHECK THAT AWS INTERVIEW SHUBHAM SEND AND THEN LEARN NETWORKING ONLY AND ASK FOR REFERRAL. SEE IF ALL THE TOPICS YOU HAVE DONE THEN. ASK FOR REFERAL. DO CN AND GET DONE.
* FOR DEMS JUT ORGANISE INDEX. DO ONLY HARD TOPICS AND JUST ADD LINK. MYNOTES CHECK AND REMOVE. BECAUSE DBMS INTERVIEW IS VERY LESS AND ONLY PRIMARY KEY ETC ARE ASKED NOT SE DEPTH UNLESS.
* LEARN MORE CN - OR READY CN INDEX AND TOPICS TO COMPLETE SHUBHAM AWS INTERVIEW HE SENT.
* CN - GFG Indexes added that other one index in. Also add interviewbit in git now.
* Interview_ Learning Readme.md also add in your git. About how to do for different scenarios and how you are doing and how to approach for learning.
  * For springboot java - You can always learn a day or two for whole interview
  * for microservices - you have some notes you konw- you can download interviewbit. but practical knowledge you have done and it is better.
  * For OS/CN shubham again ask for referral and ask him to help you with the test.
  * For other companies first ask for referral, usually they will skip the test part. But on interview also they ask some leetcode questions so keep learning
  * Keep learning leetcode in daily basis, some and some,
* When you are assigned with Sprint task in BofA, then always keep that as priority and learn more in bank for java, spring and microservices first in priority.

        //max possible value in our knapsack.
        //Also remember as Repetitions of items is not allowed, so once you pick the current item, don't just stay there but go one set item back
        //means like excluding currentItem, from previous sub-problem.

                //Hence pick only those items whose weight is less than currentCapacity
                if (currentCapacity >= itemWeight[takenItem-1]) { //As since index starts from 0, so takenItem-1 is done to get that item

                    //previous capacity exclude this current item.
                    //other we will pick what was our value until now in this current capacity only just one item previously
                    //So we will pick this two item, and get max value, hence code as
                    DP[currentCapacity][takenItem] = Math.max(DP[currentCapacity - itemWeight[takenItem-1]][takenItem - 1] + itemValue[takenItem-1], DP[currentCapacity][takenItem - 1]);

                    //Here this <DP[currentCapacity][takenItem-1]> completely depicts, just put what was previous value for currentTarget when this takenItem was not considered. what if that is max, so this way we find max value
                } else {
                    //In else condition, mostly when weight to taken item is coming greater than knapsack currentCapacity weight,
                    //So in this case just store the previous value we have calculated till now for currentCapacity and exclude current takenItem

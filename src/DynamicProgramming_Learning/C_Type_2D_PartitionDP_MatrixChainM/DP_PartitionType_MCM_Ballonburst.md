# ADVANCED LEVEL DP SAMPLE PROBLEM SOLVING AND LEARNING (PARTITION DP)
* This two below topic is very difficult to understand. So made separate readme file for it for explain and learn

## INCLUDES TWO PROBLEMS TYPE OF DP
### 1. MATRIX CHAIN MULTIPLICATION RELATE TO DP
* In geeksforgeeks you can find here the code to solve and submit
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/matrix-chain-multiplication0303/1

### 2. BALLOON BURST QUESTION RELATED TO DP
* In geeksforgeeks code solved at here
* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/burst-balloons/1




## 1. MATRIX CHAIN MULTIPLICATION USING DP 
* SEE VIDEOS BELOW TO UNDERSTAND PROBLEM AND APPROACH
* CODE I HAVE WRITTEN IN TYPE_2D_PARTITIONDP_MATRIXCHAINM - CHECK THERE
* I HAVE MY OWN VIDEO TO LET YOU UNDERSTAND HOW ITERATIVE APPROACH IS LOGICALLY IMPLEMENTED BY TAKING THE 2D ARRAY REPRESENTATION AND EXPLAINING EACH CELL AND EACH FOR LOOP AND EACH ELEMENT TOGETHER AND SUBARRAY TAKEN AT A TIME. CHECK THAT VIDEO. SINCE IT'S LENGTHY VIDEO IT IS STORED IN LAPTOP OR HARDDRIVE CHECK THERE.

#### YT 0 - 2 VIDEOS
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRVfmbCFW7Y&list=WL&index=37&t=3096s&ab_channel=takeUforward
* FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS PROBLEM AND RECURSIVE AS FIRST SO THAT WE CAN MOVE TO TABULATION/ITERATIVE APPROACH

#### YT 1 - 1 VIDEO
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UPo_dzBw1c&t=875s&ab_channel=AnujKumarSharma
* BEST EXPLAINED WITH CODE AND DP ARRAY REPRESENTATION AND LEN=2 EXPLAINED WELL. 
* ALSO EXPLAINED SUB-PROBLEM AND OVERLAPPING


#### YT 2 - 1 VIDEO
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv4z9fJ_lB0&ab_channel=CSEconceptswithParinita
* BEST EXPLAINED WITH FORMULA BUT 






## 2. BALOON BURST QUESTION USING DP
* YT watched below and well explained.
* I have written the code also with explanation, but better watch youtube first.
* also you first learn MCM to understand this concepts.
* PDF will attach once taken.
* It is already well explained in the YT by striver on how logically we can have independent sub-problem
    * By taking such subarray where we think of bursting the element in the last.
    * This is one very good concept to understand in whole of this problem. 
    * bursting the balloon at last concept can only help us in coming dp approach. As in that case only we don't 
    * have any dependency in right or left subarray/subproblem of dp.


### YT 1 : Striver 90% Good with final approach and code
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz4LlDSlkns&t=7s&ab_channel=takeUforward

### YT 2 : Other 75% good with explanation but code in python
